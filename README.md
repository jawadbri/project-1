### **_discription_**

#### i'm thinking of doing a memory game _--_ thinking about making it a 2x2 first to check hown to make it fully functional _--_ then i ='m thinking of making it a 4x4. the first html is the introduction of the game _--_ with the rules. if possible to have a continue button to refresh the board with your point and a restart\stop button.

## the framework

###### it's ugly for now cuz of paint

#### how it works?

##### add a div in the html to make the box _--_ add style to make visibale _--_ (optional _--_ make it hover to know it's clickable) _--_ make it clickable _--_ add a transaction fo it then change it _--_ if one worked out we add more _--_ make the display grid to make them go side by side _--_ we make shower every single one is clickable (propaply in a function) _--_ narrow it down to make only 2 clickable at a time _--_ give every pair the same class _--_ make an array of the soulutions _--_ if statement to check if the 2 are from the same class ( if right change their color to be seen _--_ and add 100 points to score) if else ( if statment to check if the points are more than 10) then -10 points to the score (else _--_ do nothing) _--_ the classes will be randomized (how?? _--_ if not possible _--_ scratch the class idea and make it inner text with 0 transparency) _--_ same boxes same color _--_ continue btn to refresh the board without restarting the point and make it addable to the one from before _--_ restart/stop will refresh both.
