### **_discription_**

#### battleShip _--_ you get 3 lifes so hopefully no mistakes _--_ a 5x6 box to choose where do you wanna bomb

## the framework

###### it's ugly for now cuz of paint

#### how it works?

##### making the main box _--_ making the boxes itself _--_ make a button to refresh the board _--_ eventlistner to check what's inside of them _--_ if the EL works we start by making the ships in a location _--_ check if thr EL still works or tweak it _--_ add life points for losing _--_ connecting the lifepoints with the EL so when you guess wrong u loose a life _--_ make the refresh change the ship locatin _--_ up to now the location is set, we now try to make the location randomized. _--_ we don't want the random locartion to be all of the place, we're doing battle ships not minesweeper so they need to be toggether. _--_ connect 3 divs to make one ship (with the same class, or make the inner text to be the same) _--_ connect 4 divs _--_ connect 2.

##### that's it for now.

##### what to do

[x] make the main box
[x] make the button
[] make the small boxese (1 out 5/4 is done)
[] mark the ships
[] make the ship work if clicked
[] lifepoints
[] lose life if you guess wrongly
[] change the div css on every click

- guessing wrongly make the css red and green for correct
  [] make it works
  [] make it random
  [x] lose my mind...
